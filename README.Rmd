# highlight

highlight is a syntax highlighter for R code. 

## Installation

You can install highlight from github with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("romainfrancois/highlight")
```

## Typical highlighting (lestrade)

Typical syntax highlighting is only interested in whether a token is a function 
call, a keyword, a string, ... this is what the `lestrade` detective does:

```r
library(highlight)
highlight( file = "css_file.R", detective = lestrade )
# Generate html file to preview externally 
tmp_page <- tempfile(pattern = "highlight_preview", fileext = ".html")
capture.output(cat(
    highlight(
        file = "./R/css_file.R",
        detective = lestrade,
        header = document_header()
    )
),
file = tmp_page)
# Open in RStudio
rstudioapi::viewer(tmp_page, height = NULL)
```

This will look like this: 

![](img/lestrade.png)

This differentiates <span class="functioncall">function calls</span>, 
<span class="symbol_formalargs">formal arguments</span>,  <span class="symbol_argument">used arguments</span> ... 
because `lestrade` identified these tokens as such. 

## semantic highlighting (sherlock)

Traditional highlighting only reveals the obvious, so the package also benefits from 
the investigation of `sherlock` for semantic highlighting. In semantic highlighting, 
every symbol gets a different color. 

```r
highlight( file = "css_file.R", detective = sherlock )
```

With this we can quickly skim through the file and see e.g. the different uses of `filename`. 

## In rmarkdown

To use in `rmarkdown` you can use the `hl_hook_source` and `hl_hook_document` hooks. Unfortunately this 
does not work for README on github so this document uses screenshots. 

```r
knitr::knit_hooks$set( 
  source = hl_hook_source, 
  document = hl_hook_css
)
```
